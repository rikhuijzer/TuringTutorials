        "## Introduction\n\nThis is the first of a series of tutorials on the universal probabilistic programming language **Turing**.\n\nTuring is a probabilistic programming system written entirely in Julia. It has an intuitive modelling syntax and supports a wide range of sampling-based inference algorithms. Most importantly, Turing inference is composable: it combines Markov chain sampling operations on subsets of model variables, e.g. using a combination of a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) engine and a particle Gibbs (PG) engine. This composable inference engine allows the user to easily switch between black-box style inference methods such as HMC and customized inference methods.\n \nFamiliarity with Julia is assumed throughout this tutorial. If you are new to Julia, [Learning Julia](https://julialang.org/learning/) is a good starting point.\n\nFor users new to Bayesian machine learning, please consider more thorough introductions to the field, such as [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387310732). This tutorial tries to provide an intuition for Bayesian inference and gives a simple example on how to use Turing. Note that this is not a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian machine learning.\n\n### Coin Flipping Without Turing\nThe following example illustrates the effect of updating our beliefs with every piece of new evidence we observe. In particular, assume that we are unsure about the probability of heads in a coin flip. To get an intuitive understanding of what \"updating our beliefs\" is, we will visualize the probability of heads in a coin flip after each observed evidence.\n\nFirst, let's load some of the packages we need to flip a coin (`Random`, `Distributions`) and show our results (`Plots`). You will note that Turing is not an import here — we do not need it for this example. If you are already familiar with posterior updates, you can proceed to the next step."

        "With our priors set and our data at hand, we can perform Bayesian inference.\n\nThis is a fairly simple process. We expose one additional coin flip to our model every iteration, such that the first run only sees the first coin flip, while the last iteration sees all the coin flips. Then, we set the `updated_belief` variable to an updated version of the original Beta distribution that accounts for the new proportion of heads and tails. \n\nFor the mathematically inclined, the `Beta` distribution is updated by adding each coin flip to the distribution's $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters, which are initially defined as $\\alpha = 1, \\beta = 1$. Over time, with more and more coin flips, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ will be approximately equal to each other as we are equally likely to flip a heads or a tails, and the plot of the beta distribution will become more tightly centered around 0.5. \n\nThis works because mean of the `Beta` distribution is defined as the following:\n\n$$\\text{E}[\\text{Beta}] = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}$$\n\nWhich is 0.5 when $\\alpha = \\beta$, as we expect for a large enough number of coin flips. As we increase the number of samples, our variance will also decrease, such that the distribution will reflect less uncertainty about the probability of receiving a heads. The definition of the variance for the `Beta` distribution is the following:\n\n$$\\text{var}[\\text{Beta}] = \\dfrac{\\alpha\\beta}{(\\alpha + \\beta)^2 (\\alpha + \\beta + 1)}$$\n\nThe intuition about this definition is that the variance of the distribution will approach 0 with more and more samples, as the denominator will grow faster than will the numerator. More samples means less variance."

The orange line in the animation represents the true probability of seeing heads on a single coin flip, while the mode of the distribution shows what the model believes the probability of a heads is given the evidence it has seen.\n\n### Coin Flipping With Turing\n\nIn the previous example, we used the fact that our prior distribution is a [conjugate prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior). Note that a closed-form expression (the `updated_belief` expression) for the posterior is not accessible in general and usually does not exist for more interesting models. \n\nWe are now going to move away from the closed-form expression above and specify the same model using **Turing**. To do so, we will first need to import `Turing`, `MCMCChains`, `Distributions`, and `StatPlots`. `MCMCChains` is a library built by the Turing team to help summarize Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, as well as a variety of utility functions for diagnostics and visualizations."
