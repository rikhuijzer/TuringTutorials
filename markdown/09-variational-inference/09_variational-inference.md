In this post we'll have a look at what's know as **variational inference (VI)**, a family of _approximate_ Bayesian inference methods, and how to use it in Turing.jl as an alternative to other approaches such as MCMC. In particular, we will focus on one of the more standard VI methods called **Automatic Differentation Variational Inference (ADVI)**.

Here we will focus on how to use VI in Turing and not much on the theory underlying VI. If you're interested in understanding the mathematics you can checkout [our write-up](../../docs/for-developers/variational_inference) or any other resource online (there a lot of great ones).

Using VI in Turing.jl is very straight forward. If `model` denotes a definition of a `Turing.Model`, performing VI is as simple as
```julia
m = model(data...) # instantiate model on the data
q = vi(m, vi_alg)  # perform VI on `m` using the VI method `vi_alg`, which returns a `VariationalPosterior`
```


Thus it's no more work than standard MCMC sampling in Turing.

To get a bit more into what we can do with `vi`, we'll first have a look at a simple example and then we'll reproduce the [tutorial on Bayesian linear regression](../../tutorials/5-linearregression) using VI instead of MCMC. Finally we'll look at some of the different parameters of `vi` and how you for example can use your own custom variational family.

## Setup

```julia
using Random
using Turing
using Turing: Variational

Random.seed!(42);
```




## Simple example: Normal-Gamma conjugate model

The Normal-(Inverse)Gamma conjugate model is defined by the following generative process

\begin{align}
    s &\sim \mathrm{InverseGamma}(2, 3) \\\\
    m &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, s) \\\\
    x_i &\overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{=} \mathcal{N}(m, s), \quad i = 1, \dots, n
\end{align}

Recall that *conjugate* refers to the fact that we can obtain a closed-form expression for the posterior. Of course one wouldn't use something like variational inference for a conjugate model, but it's useful as a simple demonstration as we can compare the result to the true posterior.

First we generate some synthetic data, define the `Turing.Model` and instantiate the model on the data:

```julia
# generate data
x = randn(2000);
```


```julia
@model function model(x)
    s ~ InverseGamma(2, 3)
    m ~ Normal(0.0, sqrt(s))
    for i = 1:length(x)
        x[i] ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s))
    end
end;
```


```julia
# Instantiate model
m = model(x);
```




Now we'll produce some samples from the posterior using a MCMC method, which in constrast to VI is guaranteed to converge to the *exact* posterior (as the number of samples go to infinity).

We'll produce 10 000 samples with 200 steps used for adaptation and a target acceptance rate of 0.65

If you don't understand what "adaptation" or "target acceptance rate" refers to, all you really need to know is that `NUTS` is known to be one of the most accurate and efficient samplers (when applicable) while requiring little to no hand-tuning to work well.

```julia
samples_nuts = sample(m, NUTS(200, 0.65), 10_000);
```




Now let's try VI. The most important function you need to now about to do VI in Turing is `vi`:


```julia
@doc(Variational.vi)
```


```
vi(model, alg::VariationalInference)
vi(model, alg::VariationalInference, q::VariationalPosterior)
vi(model, alg::VariationalInference, getq::Function, θ::AbstractArray)
```

Constructs the variational posterior from the `model` and performs the optimization following the configuration of the given `VariationalInference` instance.

# Arguments

  * `model`: `Turing.Model` or `Function` z ↦ log p(x, z) where `x` denotes the observations
  * `alg`: the VI algorithm used
  * `q`: a `VariationalPosterior` for which it is assumed a specialized implementation of the variational objective used exists.
  * `getq`: function taking parameters `θ` as input and returns a `VariationalPosterior`
  * `θ`: only required if `getq` is used, in which case it is the initial parameters for the variational posterior




Additionally, you can pass
- an initial variational posterior `q`, for which we assume there exists a implementation of `update(::typeof(q), θ::AbstractVector)` returning an updated posterior `q` with parameters `θ`.
- a function mapping $\theta \mapsto q_{\theta}$ (denoted above `getq`) together with initial parameters `θ`. This provides more flexibility in the types of variational families that we can use, and can sometimes be slightly more convenient for quick and rough work.

By default, i.e. when calling `vi(m, advi)`, Turing use a *mean-field* approximation with a multivariate normal as the base-distribution. Mean-field refers to the fact that we assume all the latent variables to be *independent*. This the "standard" ADVI approach; see [Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00788) for more. In Turing, one can obtain such a mean-field approximation by calling `Variational.meanfield(model)` for which there exists an internal implementation for `update`:


```julia
@doc(Variational.meanfield)
```


```
meanfield([rng, ]model::Model)
```

Creates a mean-field approximation with multivariate normal as underlying distribution.




Currently the only implementation of `VariationalInference` available is `ADVI`, which is very convenient and applicable as long as your `Model` is differentiable with respect to the *variational parameters*, that is, the parameters of your variational distribution, e.g. mean and variance in the mean-field approximation.


```julia
@doc(Variational.ADVI)
```


```julia
struct ADVI{AD} <: AdvancedVI.VariationalInference{AD}
```

Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) with automatic differentiation backend `AD`.

# Fields

  * `samples_per_step::Int64`

    Number of samples used to estimate the ELBO in each optimization step.
  * `max_iters::Int64`

    Maximum number of gradient steps.




To perform VI on the model `m` using 10 samples for gradient estimation and taking 1000 gradient steps is then as simple as:


```julia
# ADVI
advi = ADVI(10, 1000)
q = vi(m, advi);
```




Unfortunately, for such a small problem Turing's new `NUTS` sampler is *so* efficient now that it's not that much more efficient to use ADVI. So, so very unfortunate...

With that being said, this is not the case in general. For very complex models we'll later find that `ADVI` produces very reasonable results in a much shorter time than `NUTS`.

And one significant advantage of using `vi` is that we can sample from the resulting `q` with ease. In fact, the result of the `vi` call is a `TransformedDistribution` from Bijectors.jl, and it implements the Distributions.jl interface for a `Distribution`:


```julia
q isa MultivariateDistribution
```

```
true
```





This means that we can call `rand` to sample from the variational posterior `q`


```julia
rand(q)
```

```
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.102518876163901
 -0.040522215022759496
```





and `logpdf` to compute the log-probability


```julia
logpdf(q, rand(q))
```

```
4.907636098214983
```





Let's check the first and second moments of the data to see how our approximation compares to the point-estimates form the data:


```julia
var(x), mean(x)
```

```
(1.0225001600719719, -0.027900450605557185)
```



```julia
(mean(rand(q, 1000); dims = 2)..., )
```

```
(1.0092761373397834, -0.0280045068429487)
```






That's pretty close! But we're Bayesian so we're not interested in *just* matching the mean.
Let's instead look the actual density `q`. 

For that we need samples:


```julia
samples = rand(q, 10000);
```


```julia
# setup for plotting
using Plots, LaTeXStrings, StatsPlots
```


```julia
p1 = histogram(samples[1, :], bins=100, normed=true, alpha=0.2, color = :blue, label = "")
density!(samples[1, :], label = "s (ADVI)", color = :blue, linewidth = 2)
density!(samples_nuts, :s; label = "s (NUTS)", color = :green, linewidth = 2)
vline!([var(x)], label = "s (data)", color = :black)
vline!([mean(samples[1, :])], color = :blue, label ="")

p2 = histogram(samples[2, :], bins=100, normed=true, alpha=0.2, color = :blue, label = "")
density!(samples[2, :], label = "m (ADVI)", color = :blue, linewidth = 2)
density!(samples_nuts, :m; label = "m (NUTS)", color = :green, linewidth = 2)
vline!([mean(x)], color = :black, label = "m (data)")
vline!([mean(samples[2, :])], color = :blue, label="")

plot(p1, p2, layout=(2, 1), size=(900, 500))
```

For this particular `Model`, we can in fact obtain the posterior of the latent variables in closed form. This allows us to compare both `NUTS` and `ADVI` to the true posterior $p(s, m \mid \{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n )$.

*The code below is just work to get the marginals $p(s \mid \{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n)$ and $p(m \mid \{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n)$ from the posterior obtained using ConjugatePriors.jl. Feel free to skip it.*

# Bayesian linear regression example using `ADVI`

This is simply a duplication of the tutorial [5. Linear regression](../regression/02_linear-regression) but now with the addition of an approximate posterior obtained using `ADVI`.

As we'll see, there is really no additional work required to apply variational inference to a more complex `Model`.

end;
```


```julia
n_obs, n_vars = size(train)
m = linear_regression(train, train_label, n_obs, n_vars);
```




## Performing VI

First we define the initial variational distribution, or, equivalently, the family of distributions to consider. We're going to use the same mean-field approximation as Turing will use by default when we call `vi(m, advi)`, which we obtain by calling `Variational.meanfield`. This returns a `TransformedDistribution` with a `TuringDiagMvNormal` as the underlying distribution and the transformation mapping from the reals to the domain of the latent variables.


```julia
q0 = Variational.meanfield(m)
typeof(q0)
```

```
Bijectors.MultivariateTransformed{DistributionsAD.TuringDiagMvNormal{Vector
{Float64}, Vector{Float64}}, Bijectors.Stacked{Tuple{Bijectors.Inverse{Bije
ctors.TruncatedBijector{0, Float64, Float64}, 0}, Bijectors.Identity{0}, Bi
jectors.Identity{1}}, Vector{UnitRange{Int64}}}} (alias for Bijectors.Trans
formedDistribution{DistributionsAD.TuringDiagMvNormal{Array{Float64, 1}, Ar
ray{Float64, 1}}, Bijectors.Stacked{Tuple{Bijectors.Inverse{Bijectors.Trunc
atedBijector{0, Float64, Float64}, 0}, Bijectors.Identity{0}, Bijectors.Ide
ntity{1}}, Array{UnitRange{Int64}, 1}}, Distributions.Multivariate})
```



```julia
advi = ADVI(10, 10_000)
```

```
AdvancedVI.ADVI{AdvancedVI.ForwardDiffAD{40}}(10, 10000)
```





Turing also provides a couple of different optimizers:
- `TruncatedADAGrad` (default)
- `DecayedADAGrad`
as these are well-suited for problems with high-variance stochastic objectives, which is usually what the ELBO ends up being at different times in our optimization process.

With that being said, thanks to Requires.jl, if we add a `using Flux` prior to `using Turing` we can also make use of all the optimizers in `Flux`, e.g. `ADAM`, without any additional changes to your code! For example:
```julia
using Flux, Turing
using Turing.Variational

vi(m, advi; optimizer = Flux.ADAM())
```


just works.

For this problem we'll use the `DecayedADAGrad` from Turing:


```julia
opt = Variational.DecayedADAGrad(1e-2, 1.1, 0.9)
```

```
AdvancedVI.DecayedADAGrad(0.01, 1.1, 0.9, IdDict{Any, Any}())
```



```julia
q = vi(m, advi, q0; optimizer = opt)
typeof(q)
```

```
Bijectors.MultivariateTransformed{DistributionsAD.TuringDiagMvNormal{Vector
{Float64}, Vector{Float64}}, Bijectors.Stacked{Tuple{Bijectors.Inverse{Bije
ctors.TruncatedBijector{0, Float64, Float64}, 0}, Bijectors.Identity{0}, Bi
jectors.Identity{1}}, Vector{UnitRange{Int64}}}} (alias for Bijectors.Trans
formedDistribution{DistributionsAD.TuringDiagMvNormal{Array{Float64, 1}, Ar
ray{Float64, 1}}, Bijectors.Stacked{Tuple{Bijectors.Inverse{Bijectors.Trunc
atedBijector{0, Float64, Float64}, 0}, Bijectors.Identity{0}, Bijectors.Ide
ntity{1}}, Array{UnitRange{Int64}, 1}}, Distributions.Multivariate})
```





*Note: as mentioned before, we internally define a `update(q::TransformedDistribution{<:TuringDiagMvNormal}, θ::AbstractVector)` method which takes in the current variational approximation `q` together with new parameters `z` and returns the new variational approximation. This is required so that we can actually update the `Distribution` object after each optimization step.*

*Alternatively, we can instead provide the mapping $\theta \mapsto q_{\theta}$ directly together with initial parameters using the signature `vi(m, advi, getq, θ_init)` as mentioned earlier. We'll see an explicit example of this later on!*

To compute statistics for our approximation we need samples:


```julia
z = rand(q, 10_000);
```




Now we can for example look at the average


```julia
avg = vec(mean(z; dims = 2))
```

```

The vector has the same ordering as the model, e.g. in this case `σ₂` has index `1`, `intercept` has index `2` and `coefficients` has indices `3:12`. If  you forget or you might want to do something programmatically with the result, you can obtain the `sym → indices` mapping as follows:


```julia
_, sym2range = bijector(m, Val(true));
sym2range
```

```
(intercept = UnitRange{Int64}[2:2], σ₂ = UnitRange{Int64}[1:1], coefficient

*Note: as you can see, this is slightly awkward to work with at the moment. We'll soon add a better way of dealing with this.*

With a bit of work (this will be much easier in the future), we can also visualize the approximate marginals of the different variables, similar to `plot(chain)`:


```julia
function plot_variational_marginals(z, sym2range)
    ps = []

    for (i, sym) in enumerate(keys(sym2range))
        indices = union(sym2range[sym]...)  # <= array of ranges
        if sum(length.(indices)) > 1
            offset = 1
            for r in indices
                for j in r
                    p = density(z[j, :], title = "$(sym)[$offset]", titlefontsize = 10, label = "")
                    push!(ps, p)

                    offset += 1
                end
            end
        else
            p = density(z[first(indices), :], title = "$(sym)", titlefontsize = 10, label = "")
            push!(ps, p)
        end
    end
    
    return plot(ps..., layout = (length(ps), 1), size = (500, 1500))
end
```

```

```

One thing we can look at is simply the squared error between the means:


```julia
sum(abs2, mean(chain).nt.mean .- vi_mean)
```

```
1.9986140225247249
```





That looks pretty good! But let's see how the predictive distributions looks for the two.

## Prediction

Similarily to the linear regression tutorial, we're going to compare to multivariate ordinary linear regression using the `GLM` package:


```julia
# Import the GLM package.
using GLM

# Perform multivariate OLS.
ols = lm(@formula(MPG ~ Cyl + Disp + HP + DRat + WT + QSec + VS + AM + Gear + Carb), train_cut)

# Store our predictions in the original dataframe.
train_cut.OLSPrediction = unstandardize(GLM.predict(ols), data.MPG);
test_cut.OLSPrediction = unstandardize(GLM.predict(ols, test_cut), data.MPG);
```


```julia
# Make a prediction given an input vector.
function prediction_chain(chain, x)
    p = get_params(chain)
    α = mean(p.intercept)
    β = collect(mean.(p.coefficients))
    return  α .+ x * β
end
```

```
prediction_chain (generic function with 1 method)
```



```julia
# Make a prediction using samples from the variational posterior given an input vector.
function prediction(samples::AbstractVector, sym2ranges, x)
    α = mean(samples[union(sym2ranges[:intercept]...)])
    β = vec(mean(samples[union(sym2ranges[:coefficients]...)]; dims = 2))
    return  α .+ x * β
end

function prediction(samples::AbstractMatrix, sym2ranges, x)
    α = mean(samples[union(sym2ranges[:intercept]...), :])
    β = vec(mean(samples[union(sym2ranges[:coefficients]...), :]; dims = 2))
    return  α .+ x * β
end
```

```
prediction (generic function with 2 methods)
```



```julia
# Unstandardize the dependent variable.
train_cut.MPG = unstandardize(train_cut.MPG, data.MPG);
test_cut.MPG = unstandardize(test_cut.MPG, data.MPG);
```


```julia
# Show the first side rows of the modified dataframe.
first(test_cut, 6)
```

```

Interestingly the squared difference between true- and mean-prediction on the test-set is actually *better* for the mean-field variational posterior than for the "true" posterior obtained by MCMC sampling using `NUTS`. But, as Bayesians, we know that the mean doesn't tell the entire story. One quick check is to look at the mean predictions ± standard deviation of the two different approaches:


```julia
z = rand(q, 1000);
preds = hcat([unstandardize(prediction(z[:, i], sym2range, test), data.MPG) for i = 1:size(z, 2)]...);

scatter(1:size(test, 1), mean(preds; dims = 2), yerr=std(preds; dims = 2), label="prediction (mean ± std)", size = (900, 500), markersize = 8)
scatter!(1:size(test, 1), unstandardize(test_label, data.MPG), label="true")
xaxis!(1:size(test, 1))
ylims!(95, 140)
title!("Mean-field ADVI (Normal)")
```

![](figures/09_variational-inference_54_1.png)

```julia
preds = hcat([unstandardize(prediction_chain(chain[i], test), data.MPG) for i = 1:5:size(chain, 1)]...);

scatter(1:size(test, 1), mean(preds; dims = 2), yerr=std(preds; dims = 2), label="prediction (mean ± std)", size = (900, 500), markersize = 8)
scatter!(1:size(test, 1), unstandardize(test_label, data.MPG), label="true")
xaxis!(1:size(test, 1))
ylims!(95, 140)
title!("MCMC (NUTS)")
```

![](figures/09_variational-inference_55_1.png)



Indeed we see that the MCMC approach generally provides better uncertainty estimates than the mean-field ADVI approach! Good. So all the work we've done to make MCMC fast isn't for nothing.

## Alternative: provide parameter-to-distribution instead of `q` with`update` implemented

As mentioned earlier, it's also possible to just provide the mapping $\theta \mapsto q_{\theta}$ rather than the variational family / initial variational posterior `q`, i.e. use the interface `vi(m, advi, getq, θ_init)` where `getq` is the mapping $\theta \mapsto q_{\theta}$

In this section we're going to construct a mean-field approximation to the model by hand using a composition of`Shift` and `Scale` from Bijectors.jl togheter with a standard multivariate Gaussian as the base distribution. 


```julia
using Bijectors
```


```julia
using Bijectors: Scale, Shift
```


```julia
d = length(q)
base_dist = Turing.DistributionsAD.TuringDiagMvNormal(zeros(d), ones(d))
```

```
DistributionsAD.TuringDiagMvNormal{Vector{Float64}, Vector{Float64}}(
m: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
σ: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
)
```





`bijector(model::Turing.Model)` is defined by Turing, and will return a `bijector` which takes you from the space of the latent variables to the real space. In this particular case, this is a mapping `((0, ∞) × ℝ × ℝ¹⁰) → ℝ¹²`. We're interested in using a normal distribution as a base-distribution and transform samples to the latent space, thus we need the inverse mapping from the reals to the latent space:


```julia
to_constrained = inv(bijector(m));
```


```julia
function getq(θ)
    d = length(θ) ÷ 2
    A = @inbounds θ[1:d]
    b = @inbounds θ[d + 1: 2 * d]
    
    b = to_constrained ∘ Shift(b; dim = Val(1)) ∘ Scale(exp.(A); dim = Val(1))
    
    return transformed(base_dist, b)
end
```

```
getq (generic function with 1 method)
```



```julia
q_mf_normal = vi(m, advi, getq, randn(2 * d));
```


```julia
p1 = plot_variational_marginals(rand(q_mf_normal, 10_000), sym2range) # MvDiagNormal + Affine transformation + to_constrained
p2 = plot_variational_marginals(rand(q, 10_000), sym2range)  # Turing.meanfield(m)

plot(p1, p2, layout = (1, 2), size = (800, 2000))
```

![](figures/09_variational-inference_62_1.png)


As expected, the fits look pretty much identical.

But using this interface it becomes trivial to go beyond the mean-field assumption we made for the variational posterior, as we'll see in the next section.

### Relaxing the mean-field assumption

Here we'll instead consider the variational family to be a full non-diagonal multivariate Gaussian. As in the previous section we'll implement this by transforming a standard multivariate Gaussian using `Scale` and `Shift`, but now `Scale` will instead be using a lower-triangular matrix (representing the Cholesky of the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal) in contrast to the diagonal matrix we used in for the mean-field approximate posterior.


```julia
using LinearAlgebra
```


```julia
# Using `ComponentArrays.jl` together with `UnPack.jl` makes our lives much easier.
using ComponentArrays, UnPack
```


```julia
proto_arr = ComponentArray(
    L = zeros(d, d),
    b = zeros(d)
)
proto_axes = proto_arr |> getaxes
num_params = length(proto_arr)

function getq(θ)
    L, b = begin
        @unpack L, b = ComponentArray(θ, proto_axes)
        LowerTriangular(L), b
    end
    # For this to represent a covariance matrix we need to ensure that the diagonal is positive.
    # We can enforce this by zeroing out the diagonal and then adding back the diagonal exponentiated.
    D = Diagonal(diag(L))
    A = L - D + exp(D) # exp for Diagonal is the same as exponentiating only the diagonal entries
    
    b = to_constrained ∘ Shift(b; dim = Val(1)) ∘ Scale(A; dim = Val(1))
    
    return transformed(base_dist, b)
end
```

```
getq (generic function with 1 method)
```



```julia
advi = ADVI(10, 20_000)
```

```
AdvancedVI.ADVI{AdvancedVI.ForwardDiffAD{40}}(10, 20000)
```



```julia
q_full_normal = vi(m, advi, getq, randn(num_params); optimizer = Variational.DecayedADAGrad(1e-2));
```




Let's have a look at the learned covariance matrix:


```julia
A = q_full_normal.transform.ts[1].a
```

So it seems like the "full" ADVI approach, i.e. no mean-field assumption, obtain the same modes as the mean-field approach but with greater uncertainty for some of the `coefficients`. This 


```julia
# Unfortunately, it seems like this has quite a high variance which is likely to be due to numerical instability, 
# so we consider a larger number of samples. If we get a couple of outliers due to numerical issues, 
# these kind affect the mean prediction greatly.

Here we actually see that indeed both the full ADVI and the MCMC approaches does a much better job of quantifying the uncertainty of predictions for never-before-seen samples, with full ADVI seemingly *underestimating* the variance slightly compared to MCMC.

So now you know how to do perform VI on your Turing.jl model! Great isn't it?
